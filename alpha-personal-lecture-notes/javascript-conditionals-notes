//Javascript Conditionals 2/15/23

//Conditionals: decision trees, if/else statements, conditional statements
    //use conditions to produce an output
    //Conditions: determine if a value is true or false (Boolean values)
    //The first true condition will produce an output for the conditional. Only
    //one output per conditional.

//Conditions
    //Boolean values: true or false
    //Conditions are setup by three operators
        //Operators
        //Equality: == loose or === strict
            //Examples
            var num = 23
            console.log(num === 23) //true
            console.log(num === 20) //false
            console.log(num == "23") //true: type coercion
            console.log(num === "23") //false because different data types 
        //Relational: <, <=, >, >=
            //Examples
            var myName = "CJ"
            console.log(num > 20) //true
            console.log(num > myName) //false: different data types
            console.log(num > myName.length) //true: comparing number and number of characters in the string
        //Logical: &&, ||, ! (Bang operator, Not, Negation)
            //Examples
            //Logical &&
            console.log(num > 20 && num > myName.length) //true: both conditions are true
            console.log(num < 20 && num > myName.length) //false: because first condition is false. 
            //&& only produces true when all conditions are true

            //Logical ||
            console.log(num < 20 || num > myName.length) //true: || only needs one condition to be true

            //Negation
            console.log(!(num < 20 || num > myName.length)) //false: negate the outcome of the whole condition

//Conditionals
    //if: takes a condition () and performs logic {}
        //only one if per conditional
    if (num > 18){
        console.log("This number is great than 18!")
    }
    //else: only performs logic if the other conditions are false, catchall
        //only one else per conditional
    var favColor = "blue"
    //var nextColor = "pink"
    if(favColor === "purple"){
        console.log("Have you considered blue?")
    } else{
        console.log("Blue is a better color!")
    }
    //else if: allows to include additional conditions and logic
    if(favColor === "purple"){
        console.log("Have you considered blue?")
    } else if(favColor === "pink"){ 
        console.log("That is the second best color to blue!")
    } else if (favColor === "blue"){
        console.log("You have great taste!")
    } else{
        console.log("Try blue")
    }
    //output changes based on what favColor is assigned to for this example
